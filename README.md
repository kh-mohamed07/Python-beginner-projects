# Python Beginner Projects

This repository contains beginner-level Python projects I built while learning programming , including:

- **Guess_the_number** – A simple number guessing game.
- **HANGMAN** – Classic Hangman game in Python.
- **rps** – Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

Each project is in its own folder and can be run independently.
