# 🎲 Guess the Number Game
This is **my first coding project** built with Python!
A fun beginner-friendly Python project where you can play a **number guessing game** in two different modes:
1. **Computer Version** – You guess the number chosen by the computer.
2. **User Version** – The computer tries to guess the number you are thinking of.

## 🚀 How to Play

### ▶️ Computer Version
- The computer picks a random number between **0 and 100**.
- You try to guess the number.
- After each guess, the computer will give you hints:
  - **"too low"** if your guess is much smaller than the number.  
  - **"too high"** if your guess is much bigger than the number.  
  - A softer hint if you’re close.
- You have **10 attempts** to guess correctly.
- If you guess right, you win! 🎉

### ▶️ User Version
- You think of a number between **0 and 100**, and the **computer will try to guess it**.
- After each guess, you give feedback:
  - **C** → Correct  
  - **H** → Too high  
  - **L** → Too low  
- The computer narrows down the range and keeps guessing until it finds your number.
